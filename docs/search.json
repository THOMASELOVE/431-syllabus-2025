We emphasize the key roles of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research.\nThe course is formally titled Statistical Methods in Biological & Medical Sciences, Part 1. A more accurate title is Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research.\nWe’ll learn about managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other data science activities. This highly applied course focuses on modern tools for learning from data. We’ll learn a lot of R, and we’ll use RStudio and Quarto as tools to help make R work better, and help perform our research in rigorous and replicable ways.\nDuring the 431-432 sequence, students will:\nThis is NOT a course in mathematical statistics or statistical inference.

Not much.\nUseful prior experience includes training/experience in statistics, coding/programming and biology/biomedical science. We expect most people will have some experience in one or two of these areas, but very few will have all three.\n\nSome students have lots of prior training in statistics. But there are many students in the class with no statistical training at all that they use regularly. We assume only that everyone knows what an average is, and has some sense of why statistics might be useful to them in their chosen field.\n\nSome students have lots of prior coding and programming experience, including experience with R and/or Quarto. Some have never written a line of code in their life. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn how to do modern work with data, and that means writing computer code, but that some people will be starting from nothing.\nSome students have lots of prior experience with biological and biomedical science, and know a lot of useful things in those areas which relate directly to our work. Others have zero experience in this area, and will learn a lot from their colleagues. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn, and to put in some effort to do so.\n\nPeople succeed in this course with a wide range of backgrounds and a common interest in using data effectively in research related to biology, health or medicine. There will be multiple people in the class who are years away from their last statistics class. We expect the majority of students will have no prior experience using R, or any meaningful recollection of using statistical software.\nThe pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, regardless of their field of study or prior experience. Section 100 (Professor Love’s section) is specifically geared towards students in programs under the auspices of the Department of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences, as well as students who intend to continue on and take 432 this Spring. Section 101 (with Professor Zhang) is more appropriate for most other students.",

I usually click Select All, then click Install Updates.\n\n\nA popup box may appear, asking “Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?” to which I usually answer No. A Yes response leads to a slower installation, but can solve problems if you still have them after updating.\nThis may take a few minutes. As long as you’re seeing activity in the Console window, things are progressing.\nEventually, you’ll get a message that “The downloaded source packages are in …” with a directory name. That’s the sign that the updating is done.\nUpdating packages is something you’ll do occasionally throughout the semester, mostly when a problem happens.\n\n\nFinally, choose File … Quit Session from the top menu, and accept or deny (I usually deny) RStudio’s request to save your workspace. Then close RStudio, and re-open it if you want to do some work.",

    "text": "6.7 Why do we teach R in 431-432?\nWhy do we teach using R, rather than SAS or SPSS or Python or whatever?\n\nBecause it is by far the better choice for what we’re trying to do, which is to help you become effective data scientists. And effective scientists, period.\nBecause being a data scientist means writing code and actually doing (not just talking about) replicable research, which R facilitates in an immense variety of ways.\nBecause R is free to you, me and everyone, and its community is a daily delight.\n\nTo read comments from other people on the subject, I suggest reading Why R? from Chester Ismay and Patrick Kennedy.\nAlso, the question of “Why R and not SPSS?” was nicely addressed by Greg Snow in this 2010 post at StackOverflow…\n\nWhen talking about user friendliness of computer software I like the analogy of cars vs. busses: Busses are very easy to use, you just need to know which bus to get on, where to get on, and where to get off (and you need to pay your fare). Cars on the other hand require much more work, you need to have some type of map or directions (even if the map is in your head), you need to put gas in every now and then, you need to know the rules of the road (have some type of drivers licence). The big advantage of the car is that it can take you a bunch of places that the bus does not go and it is quicker for some trips that would require transfering between busses. Using this analogy programs like SPSS are busses, easy to use for the standard things, but very frustrating if you want to do something that is not already preprogrammed. R is a 4-wheel drive SUV (though environmentally friendly) with a bike on the back, a kayak on top, good walking and running shoes in the passenger seat, and mountain climbing and spelunking gear in the back. R can take you anywhere you want to go if you take time to learn how to use the equipment, but that is going to take longer than learning where the bus stops are in SPSS.",

I don’t see a reason why this won’t also be the case this year. The course cannot be taken “pass/fail.”\nGrading standards apply in the same way for all students, regardless of whether they are enrolled in PQHS 431, CRSP 431 or MPHP 431. Students in this class are not in competition with each other for grades. I have no set percentage of students who will receive any particular grade. We aim for substantial and timely feedback from the teaching assistants and myself on all elements of the course.\nThe course grade is based on four key areas of demonstrated accomplishment.\nCourse grades are based primarily on performance on labs, projects and quizzes. Your course grade will be calculated as follows:\nThat is a total of 855 possible points, but we will pretend it is out of 850.\nThe minimum necessary score to receive a B grade in the class is 600 points (that’s 70.6% of 850.)\nThe minimum necessary score to receive an A grade in the class is 725 points (that’s 85.3% of 850.)\nWe follow the University’s Incomplete Policy, as described below.",

Along with the grade, on-time labs will receive modest feedback about the work.\nAll Labs should be turned in by the deadline specified on the Course Calendar. In this class, it is far better to turn in timely, but only partially complete work than nothing at all. We don’t give extensions on Labs. Instead, we use the following grading policy.\n\nNote that your lowest lab score (out of Labs 1-6) over the course of the semester will be dropped before we calculate your lab grade.\nTo receive full credit on a Lab, it must be received on Canvas no later than 59 minutes after the posted deadline. (This allows for small issues with uploading to Canvas to occur without penalty.)\nLabs that are turned in 1-48 hours after the deadline will lose 10 points for late work.\nNo extensions to Lab deadlines will be made this semester. Labs turned in more than 48 hours after the deadline will receive no credit, since by then the Lab Sketch will be posted.\n\nYour lowest lab score (out of Labs 1-6) over the course of the semester will be dropped before we calculate your overall lab grade.\n\nIf you decide to skip a lab, please submit a note to Canvas by the deadline saying that you are skipping the lab.

To that end, students are requested not to dispute any grading on Labs during the semester, but instead to request a review using the Lab Regrade Request Form.\nShould you receive a lower grade on a Lab than you feel you deserve based on the feedback the TA provides, the answer sketch and the grading rubric, you can submit a request for a regrade by Professor Love as follows…\nWe use this form to handle almost all grading errors and regrade requests on Labs. The only exception to this policy is when you believe we’ve made an arithmetic error in summing up your points on a lab. If that happens, just email Dr. Love to get it straightened out. The Form is used for all other regrade situations.\n\nIf you want Dr. Love to review your grade on one (or more) of Labs 1-6, fill out the Lab Regrade Request Form anytime before the deadline on the Course Calendar.\nWhen all other course work has been graded, Dr. Love will open the form. If you have requested additional points that could change your course grade, he’ll review your request. If not, then he won’t.\nDisputing a grade on a homework with a teaching assistant is pointless.\nProfessor Love is responsible for all final grading decisions, and if you have a concern, you should submit your request through the form.\n\nStudents are welcome to ask questions of Professor Love about grading during the term. The TAs and Professor Love are happy to discuss in a general sense any questions about an assignment, but no grades will be changed until the end of the term. - The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Professor Love’s attention via email, and such problems will be corrected immediately.\nThe main advantage of this system is that it saves all of us the hassle of haggling over points that are never going to mean anything anyway. It also provides “equal access” to students who are too timid to express their concerns. Finally, if there is an issue with grading a particular problem or assignment that needs to be reconsidered, Professor Love will have access to all papers and can make a universal decision1.",

Unauthorized absence from a final examination will result in a failing grade. When the student completes the work, the Incomplete is changed to an A, B, C, D, P, F, or NP.\n\n\nAll work for the incomplete grade must be made up and the change of grade recorded in the Office of the University Registrar by the date specified by the instructor, but no later than the last day of class in the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. A student who has a permanent Incomplete for a required course must retake the course in a later term. If the student cannot complete the work by the end of the following semester, he or she must petition for an extension which must be endorsed by the instructor, explain the reasons why the work has not been completed, and include a new date for completion. Students will be allowed only one extension of no more than one additional semester to complete the work for an Incomplete grade.",

All forms of academic dishonesty including cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, and obstruction are violations of academic integrity standards and will result in a minimum penalty of receiving a zero for the assignment, the potential for failing the entire course. Cheating includes copying from another’s work, falsifying problem solutions or laboratory reports, or using unauthorized sources, notes or computer programs. Plagiarism includes the presentation, without proper attribution, of another’s words or ideas from printed or electronic sources. It is also plagiarism to submit, without the instructor’s consent, an assignment in one class previously submitted in another. Misrepresentation includes forgery of official academic documents, the presentation of altered or falsified documents or testimony to a university office or official, taking an exam for another student, or lying about personal circumstances to postpone tests or assignments. Obstruction occurs when a student engages in unreasonable conduct that interferes with another’s ability to conduct scholarly activity. Destroying a student’s computer file, stealing a student’s notebook, and stealing a book on reserve in the library are examples of obstruction. In addition, the incident will be reported to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and Academic Review Board for undergraduates or Senior Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, for Graduate Students.\n\nThe CWRU Statement of Ethics for graduate students can be found here: http://case.edu/gradstudies/about-the-school/policies-procedures/.\nThe University’s Academic Integrity Policy is also worth reading.",

Is it easy to recall the main points? The answer, yes or no, depends not so much on the quality of the data, the effort, and the thinking that went into the report, nor on your own dutiful diligence in reading the report, but rather, and mainly, on whether the people who wrote the report had learned and practiced the skills of how to use words and pictures, first, to claim attention, and second, to claim retention: to deliver a message that sticks in the mind.",

    "text": "15.5 A Few Tips from Professor Love\n\nStatistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7.\nNothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables.\nDon’t parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in my words is, technically, plagiarism.\nEdit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results.\nMake your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary.\nClearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate.\nSimplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well.\nData are plural. Use “the data are …” rather than “the data is …”\nA paragraph must contain more than one sentence.\n\nDon’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout.\nDon’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result.\nSimilarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in.\nIf you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval.\n\nIf you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a p-value, then you should state something like:\n\n[1] We’re using a 95% confidence level.\n[2] We’re using a 5% significance level.\n\n[3] We’re using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\n\nDon’t use more than one of these expressions.\n\nAgain, don’t use p-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p  = 1\\).\nTo the extent possible, don’t use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Quarto allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage.\nWhen in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking leads to clear writing.",
