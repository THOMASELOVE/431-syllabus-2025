    - The [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html) also links to materials for each class, including presentation slides and announcements

## Contact Information

Our main website at <https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/> includes a [Contact Us page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/contact.html) which provides detailed information on the best ways to get help from Professor Love and the Teaching Assistants during the semester.

- The course Teaching Assistants will hold regular office hours, starting in early September and running through early December, over Zoom, and the schedule for these sessions will be found on the [Contact Us page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/contact.html) and the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html).
  - Once the semester begins, questions about course materials are best asked in class, or in TA Office Hours, over Zoom.
